Plugin for Visual Studio Code which makes navigation between files in Angular 2 project much more convenient. 
It works if you follow official naming conventions for Angular 2 files

Given set of files:
imawesome.component.ts
imawesome.component.less // or .css
imawesome.component.html

you can navigate from any of this files to all others with simple shortcut. 
For example if you’re in imawesome.component.ts but you want to edit html you simply hit Ctrl+G,H and you are now in imawesome.component.html. 
You can hit Ctrl+G,S and go to less file or Ctrl+G,T to go to typescript file. 
Obviously shortcuts can be changed.
